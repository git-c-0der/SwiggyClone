This is a frontend project in which I have created a clone of the Swiggy App. This web app has been hosted on the firebase you can access its link from \href{https://swiggy-clone-4db3e.web.app/}{here}.
  Make sure to have the CORS enable by adding it to your browser using the chrome extension else it won't be able to make calls to the API and you won't be able to see the whole results.
